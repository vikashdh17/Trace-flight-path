Day 1: Advanced Mapping with Cartopy

- Introduction to Basemap: We started by learning about the library, a powerful tool for working with geospatial data.
- Mapping major Airports: We learned how to geo-reference major airport cities on a map and visualize it using Basemap.

### Day 2: Advanced Visualization and Mapping

- Animating Visualization on maps: We learnt to animate aircraft marker from its flight from New Delhi to London. Used Daylight night shades on the map and creating wonderful visualization maps.

### Day 3: Data Generation and Gaussian Noise for Visualizing Earth's Elliptical Orbit and Curve fitting for Distribution and project showcasing and portfolio development.

- Generating Random Data Points: we were taught how to generate random data points using Python.
- Adding Gaussian Noise: We added Gaussian noise to the generated data, simulating real-world data with imperfections.
- Visualizing Earth's Orbit: In a fascinating project, we visualized a makeshift walking orbital path of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun.
- Fitting with Elliptical Distribution: We fitted the orbital data with an elliptical distribution, demonstrating the versatility of this statistical tool and providing insights into data modeling.
- Portfolio Development & project showcasing: We also learnt, how to display our projects on various social media platforms.and initiate our portfolio.
